JavaScript Engines

- Computers do not understand JavaScript
  * V8 JavaScript engine is at the heart of Nodejs
  * JS engine converts the JavaScript code into machine code something that computer can understand (compiler)
                                            
                                            MACHINE CODE

                                            JavaScript
                                                C++
                                            Assembly Language
                                            Machine Code

  * Nodejs is actually written in C++. But, as a program it allows us to write JavaScript which can run on a computer or a server
  * The reason that Nodejs is written in C++ is because it uses the V8 JavaScript engine created by Google which is also written in C++

Simply in words:
 => Nodejs is written in C++
 => At the heart of Nodejs is the V8 engine
 => The V8 engine converts our JavaScript code into Machine code 
 
- A JavaScript engine takes JavaScript and converts it into something it does understand - machine code  

How does Nodejs work with V8

 - Nodejs is written in C++ and V8 is embedded into it right there
 - When we run JavaScript and run through Nodejs it's passed into V8 and converted into machine code which the computer can understand.
    Now, V8 is just a part of Nodejs ,C++ call and there are other parts of Nodejs written in C++. So, what they do, the rest of C++ in Nodejs 
    hooks into the JavaScript V8 engine and it adds additional features to it 
 - So intially JavaScript was designed to run in a browser and it wasn't meant with lower level operations. But C++ was more powerful than 
   JavaScript
 - So, Nodejs which is written in C++ hooks into the V8 engine and it extends in such a way that passes on these additional features to 
   JavaScript such as reading and writing files or connecting to a database. This is what makes Nodejs so exciting, the fact that now we have
   greater power with JavaScript that we didn't have before and it enables us to create server side code in JavaScript.
