                                                                POST Requests
- POST is a request method
- POST requests, ask the server to accept/store data which is enclosed in the body of the request
- Often used when submitting forms            
- When we post data to the server we are no longer using the query string in the URL the data we are posting to the server is in the 
  request body itself so we need a way to handle that a little differently from get requests where we use query strings
