                                                                Buffers
- Temporary storage spot for a chunk of data that is being transferred from one place to another
- The buffer is filled with data, then passed along
- Transfer small chunks of data at a time
                                                                        BUFFER
                                              DATA PASSED ON          <--------------         |||||||||     <--||--     Data

                                                                Streams in Nodejs
- Stream is a stream of data that flows overtime from one place to another. So we'd have some kind of data source over here and we are transferring that to the client
  and data flows down the stream into the buffer 
- Can create streams in Nodejs to transfer data
- Increase performance
