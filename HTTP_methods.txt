* HTTP methods or verbs essentially the kind of requests we make 


- GET  => a get request which is what we made when we type a URL into an address bar
- POST => a post request which is generally made when we post some data to a server from a webform 
- DELETE => or delete a request
- PUT  => or put request 

The above are all different HTTP methods or verbs and they are the type of request that we make
-They all work the same like eachother 
-Each different type of request Contains a specific piece of information attached to it to say to the server what kind of request is made
-Then it's upto the server to look at what type of request it is and then treat that type of request in a particular way 
-By using express in node we can respond to each of these different types of requests at ease
